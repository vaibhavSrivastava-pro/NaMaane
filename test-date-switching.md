# Testing Date Switching Fix

## The Issue
Previously, when you:
1. Add activities to the current day (e.g., December 29)
2. Click on another day in the calendar (e.g., December 27)
3. Navigate back to the original day (December 29)

The activities would be lost or corrupted.

## The Fix
We implemented several improvements:

1. **Initialization Flag**: Added `isInitialized` state to prevent auto-save during app startup
2. **Enhanced Auto-Save**: Added debouncing (500ms) and better conditions for when to save
3. **Improved State Clearing**: The `loadDataForDate` function now properly clears all state before loading new data
4. **Better Data Validation**: Only save data when there's meaningful content
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console logs to track what's happening during date switches

## Test Steps

1. **Open the app** on your iOS device/simulator
2. **Add some activities** to today's date (e.g., "Completed project", "Read for 1 hour")
3. **Navigate to Calendar tab**
4. **Click on a different date** (preferably a past date like yesterday)
5. **Verify the new date loads correctly** (should be empty if no previous data)
6. **Navigate back to today's date** (click on today in calendar)
7. **Verify your original activities are still there**

## Expected Behavior

- Console logs should show:
  - "Saved data for date before switching: [date] with X activities"
  - "Loading data for date: [new-date]" 
  - "Auto-saved entry for [date] with X activities"
- Activities should never be lost during date transitions
- No data corruption between dates
- Smooth transitions without UI glitches

## Monitoring

Check the console output in the Expo dev tools to see the detailed logging of the date switching process.
